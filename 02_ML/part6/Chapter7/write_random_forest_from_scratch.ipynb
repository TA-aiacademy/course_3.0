        "The aim at each stage is to associate specific targets (i.e., desired output values) with specific values of a particular variable.The result is a decision-tree in which each path identifies a combination of values associated with a particular prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each non-leaf node in this tree is basically a decision maker. These nodes are called decision nodes. Each node carries out a specific test to determine where to go next. Depending on the outcome, you either go to the left branch or the right branch of this node. We keep doing this until we reach a leaf node. If we are constructing a classifier, each leaf node represents a class. Let’s say you are trying to determine whether or not it’s going to rain tomorrow based on three factors available today — temperature, pressure, and wind. So a typical decision tree would look like this:\n",
